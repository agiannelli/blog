            <h2>I'm just a girl, standing in front of the internet, talking about the stuff I like.</h2>

            <p>I am a woman of many interests, so I wear many hats. </p> 
            
            <p>Wife 👰🏻‍♀️, mother 👶, cat lady 🐱, software engineer 👩🏻‍💻, baker 🧁, musician 🎸, crafter 🧶, nail tech 💅, handywoman 🛠... the list goes on.</p>

            <p>My goal is to write about all kinds of things - tech and not-so-tech. I love sharing what interests me, and I enjoy making concepts easier for others to understand.</p>
                
            <p>I hope you enjoy my content. If there is something I haven't written about, or that needs clarification, reach out and let me know on <a href='https://twitter.com/GiannelliTech'>twitter</a>.</p>
